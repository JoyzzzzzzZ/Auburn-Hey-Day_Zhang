# Auburn-Hey-Day_Zhang
Back in 1947, students who served in WWII were returning to normalcy at Auburn University. A **Hey Day** activity was put forward by Auburn University’s student body and members of the Student Government Association in response to their request of being seen and heard. On this day every student got the opportunity to wear a **name tag** and receive warm greetings, helping everyone feel a sense of belonging. This tradition has been carried on till present days–one of the longest and most cherished traditions of our community! And marvellously, now students, faculty, and the rest of the Auburn Family are all encouraged to get involved by wearing a name tag and greeting each other, bringing all members of Auburn closer together.
